- Hi I am Bryan from Nashville Public Library and Library Freedom Project.
- I am a systems librarian at NPL
- Library Freedom Project "We provide librarians and their communities with the skills necessary to turn ideals into action."
- We are going to have fun and write some stories today. Some imaginary stories. Some realist stories. Some stories about ourselves. Some about people we serve.
- We are going to learn some tools to help protect the our community's privacy and by extension everyone's civil rights.
- I am also going to tell my own story, about people that inspire me, and hopefully inspire you too. Some warnings: talks about privacy tools means will talk about domestic abuse, police power (or the abuse thereof), and state power (or the resistance thereof).
- The submissions seemed very academic, so I went in the opposite direction.
- I also going to teach a game! And really don't have enough time so let's roll!

+ I'm from a cornfield in PA. If you think about the culture of West Virginia, that was the culture I grew up in. In graduate school, I had a boss say "Bryan you *are* a diversity candidate." I couldn't figure out what they meant by that because I was cisgender, white, male, and tall. I understand now, they meant I was hillbilly.
+ My father was union coal miner. He was a union member. He participated in strikes.
+ Because of my working class background, I was attracted to social justice movements and radical politics.
+ One reason someone like me might be concerned about privacy is that the FBI explicitly used to surveil labor unions.
+ This lead me to be interested in the intellectual freedom aspects of librarianship. Free speech and privacy go together like dungeons and dragons.
+ One of the more interesting free speech cases was that of Ward Churchill. He was an ethnic studies professor University of Colorado that railed again the government surveillance and police power. He was removed from his tenured position when implied the victims of the 9/11 attacks were "little Eichmanns" and were guilty for particupating in US's military-industrial complexy. This was a terrible thing to say.
+ Churchill is problematic for a lot of reasons, but I cannot unthink his controversial statement. I can't help to ask myself, "Am I a little Eichmann?" Am I really doing evil when I am trying to do good?" If there is a choice large or small, I try do the good thing.
+ I went to rural, public college. The English department was tiny and constantly facing budget cuts. For some reason, there were two tenured professors in the English department whose specialty was the literary history of baseball. They never said anything that would get them removed from their jobs.

+ Let me show you how to create those. Roll a pass phrase on the fly with big foam dice.
+ It's better to think of them as having a passphrase rather than a password because they need to be long. These passphrases need to be random. How do you get a long, random pass phrase? You use diceware.
