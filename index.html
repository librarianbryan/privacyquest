						Hi I am Bryan from Nashville Public Library and Library Freedom Project. We are going to have fun and write some stories today. Some imaginary stories. Some realist stories Some stories about ourselves. Some about people we serve. We are going to learn some tools to help protect the our community's privacy and by extension everyone's civil rights. I am also going to tell my own story, about people that inspire me, and hopefully inspire you too. Some warnings: talks about privacy tools means will talk about domestic abuse, police power (or the abuse thereof), and state power (or the resistance thereof). I also going to teach a game! And really don't have enough time so let's roll!

          The game I am going to teach is Ironsworn! A game perilous quests by Shawn Tomkin. 2018 ENnie Award Winner for best free game. Ironsworn is a roleplaying game that doesn't require a game master. Just like life you, players make it up as they go. You decide how difficult you want the challenges to be. You decide if you've achieved your goal or not and what the consequences are.

          I'm from a cornfield in PA. My father was union coal miner. He participated in strikes. If you think about the culture of West Virginia, that was the culture I grew up in. In graduate school, I had a boss say "Bryan you *are* a diversity candidate." I couldn't figure out what they meant by that because I was cisgender, white, male, and tall. I understand now, they meant I was hillbilly. Because of my working class background, I was attracted to social justice movements and radical politics. This lead me to be interested in the intellectual freedom aspects of librarianship. Free speech and privacy go together like dungeons and dragons. One reason someone like me might be concerned about privacy is that the FBI explicitly used to surveil labor unions. Intellectual freedom being a big part of my career means I think about what your allowed and not allowed to say. One of the more interesting free speech cases was that of Ward Churchill. He was an ethnic studies professor University of Colorado that railed again the government surveillance and police power. He was removed from his tenured position when implied the victims of the 9/11 attacks were "little Eichmanns." This was a terrible thing to say. Churchill is problematic for a lot of other reasons too, but I cannot unthink his controversial statement. I can't help to ask myself, "Am I a little Eichmann?" Am I really doing evil when I am trying to do good? If there is a choice large or small, I try do the good thing.   I went to rural, public college near Erie, Pennsylvania. The English department was small and constantly under attack from budget cuts. For some reason, there were two tenured professors in the English department whose specialty was the literary history of baseball. They never said anything that would get them removed from their jobs.

          Here are some of my other personal challenges. Are these mutually exclusive? I think some of the Challenge Ranks are off. If you are working class getting bougie job is really hard. You can't count on that happening. But if you can get a job that fulfills your soul that's worth it and that's what happened when I started working at the public library and my heart exploded. Selfishly, it made me whole in ways I had not expected. When I started a coworker said to me, "I couldn't work in academic libraries because I could not be myself." I didn't understand what they meant but now I do.

One single thing to protecting your personal privacy, and your systems, and your patrons have a gnarly passphrase. It's better to think of them as having a passphrase rather than a password because they need to be long. This passphrases need to be random. How do you get a long, randompass phrase? You use diceware.
